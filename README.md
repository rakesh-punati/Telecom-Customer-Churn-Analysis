# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

### Problem Statement
The telecom company is experiencing a high customer churn rate, which is affecting overall revenue and customer lifetime value. However, the organization lacks clear visibility into why customers are leaving. There is no unified analytical system to identify churn patterns, customer segments at risk, or service-related issues contributing to attrition.

### Project Overview
To analyze customer churn patterns and identify the key factors influencing customer attrition. To understand customer behavior based on demographics, service subscriptions, and billing information.
To measure churn rate across various customer segments such as contract type, internet service, and payment method.
To visualize business performance using interactive Power BI dashboards and KPIs.
To predict churn risk and highlight high-risk customer segments for targeted retention strategies.

### Conclusion

The Power BI dashboards provided clear visibility into customer churn behavior and patterns. Analysis revealed that high monthly charges, month-to-month contracts, and fiber optic services are major churn drivers.
Customers with longer tenure and multiple service subscriptions show greater loyalty and lower churn. Demographic factors such as senior citizen status and partner/dependent presence also influence churn tendency.
The insights enable the company to design targeted retention strategies and reduce customer loss. Implementing data-driven actions can help boost customer satisfaction, increase retention rate, and maximize revenue.
Overall, the project demonstrates how Power BI transforms raw data into actionable business insights for strategic decision-making.
